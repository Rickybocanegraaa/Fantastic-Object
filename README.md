# Fantastic-Object
  Have you ever been laying in bed for a while and just thought "it stinks." You forgot to wash your sheets for the thirty-second week in a row. I get it, we've all been there. Have you ever also seperately thought, "You know what my bed needs, more noise." Me too! Introducing the revolvosheets!
  Imagine if a treadmill, and a hand sanitizer machine had a baby, but rather than producing sweat, the sheets slowly revolve to the bottom half of the mattress equipped with sanitization and fabric softener dispensers. Battery drivin wheels equipped to the side of your bed rotate the 360 degree coverage sheets. The zippers on the sides of the sheet allows for easy application to a mattress, and the connection method between the wheels. Simply remove any blankets or pillows remaining on the bed and use your complimentary remote to activate the sheet cycle.
  Please do not lay down while activating the revolvosheets. Any harm done to your body is ruled negligence on your part as stated somewhere in the terms of condition.
